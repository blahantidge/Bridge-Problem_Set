Today's quiz is based on Audrey Grant Improving Your Judgment 1: Opening the Bidding - Opening at the One Level, Third and Fourth Position: Part 2.

<Badge type="danger" text="Bid"/>

## Introduction

The first step in valuing a hand is to look at the high-card points and distribution, but the process doesn't stop there. Your judgment, and results, will improve when you take other factors into account. Here are tips to help you make better choices when opening the bidding in third or fourth position.

### Tip # 1 - Keep the Goal in Mind

It's easy to fall into the trap of simply counting to 12 and then
opening the bidding. A better approach is to keep the objective in
mind.

Compare this hand

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠️ AQT76<br>♥️ J93<br>♦️ K75<br>♣️ 84</td>
	</tr>
</table>

to

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠️ 84<br>♥️ J93<br>♦️ K75<br>♣️ AQT76</td>
	</tr>
</table>

In first or second position, you shouldn't open either hand since the objective is to make a descriptive call that will serve as the basis for a constructive auction. Partner will expect a full opening bid.

In third position, you might open either hand with the hope of getting a small partscore or helping partner on opening lead.

In fourth position, however, you want to get a plus score, or at least not get a minus score, which might happen if you open and get too high or the opponents compete and make a contract. That's a reason for applying the Guideline of 15 - high-card points plus the number of spades - and opening with the first hand (10 + 5 = 15) but passing with the second hand (10 + 2 = 12).

### Tip # 2 - Be Prepared for the Rebid

Opener should be prepared for any response and consider the possibility of having to find a rebid.

Consider the hand

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠️ AJT75<br>♥️ Q4<br>♦️ K75<br>♣️ J83</td>
	</tr>
</table>

and

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠️ AJT75<br>♥️ 4<br>♦️ K75<br>♣️ Q832</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Both are borderline openings in third or fourth position. To avoid getting too high with the first hand after opening 1♠️, you are prepared to pass any response. Even if partner responds 2♥️ you can pass since partner should have a five-card suit or longer to bid hearts at the two level. With the second hand, however, you'll be awkwardly placed if you open 1♠️ and partner responds 2♥️. That might sway your judgment to pass rather than open.

### Tip # 3 - Be Flexible with the Guidelines

When opening in first of second position, there are guidelines when you have a choice of suits to bid. In third or fourth position, you can occasionally consider bending those guidelines.

Look at the hand

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠️ J83<br>♥️ J753<br>♦️ 94<br>♣️ AKQT</td>
	</tr>
</table>

and

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠️ J83<br>♥️ AKQT<br>♦️ 94<br>♣️ J753</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Both are borderline hands that are probably worth opening in third or fourth position. With the first hand, you'd make the standard opening bid of 1♣️. With the second hand, you might want to consider the advantage of opening 1♥️ rather than 1♣️, to suggest a lead if you don't win the auction. Even though the partnership style is five-card majors, there's always some room for judgment.

### Tip # 4 - Drury

A disadvantage of light opening bids in third and fourth position is that responder is sometimes faced with a dilemma.

Suppose you pass as South with

<table class="hand">
	<tr>
		<td>♠️ AJ4<br>♥️ K53<br>♦️ Q9542<br>♣️ 42</td>
	</tr>
</table>

and partner opens the bidding 1♥️. What call do you make?

If partner opened in first or second position, you could respond 2♦️ in Standard Methods, intending to later show the heart support. Now you can't afford to start by bidding 2♦️ since it is not forcing after your initial pass. If partner passes 2♦️, you will have missed the heart fit. An invitational jump raise to 3♥️ is not much better. You have only three-card support and you could get the partnership too high if partner has opened light. The partnership may have missed the opportunity to get a small plus score in a partscore contract of 2♥️.

To get around this problem, some partnerships adopt the Drury convention.
